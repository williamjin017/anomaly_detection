InsightData Coding challenge

#### Algorithm time complexity :

- worst run-time: O(T*N + Dn) --  N is number of users multiple T. Dn is the size of the user's D degree network

#### Space complexity:

- worst space complexity: O(U^2 + T*U)   --  U is number of users

I only changed process_log.py function, everything remains unchanged.

- Python Version: 2.7

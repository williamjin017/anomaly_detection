InsightData Coding challenge

#### Algorithm time complexity :

- O(TN) if T > number of network under the given D. N is number of streaming data events.

#### Space complexity:

- O(U^2 + T + N)   : U is number of users

I only changed process_log.py function, everything remains unchanged.

- Python Version: 2.7

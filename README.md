InsightData Coding challenge

##### N is number of users. Dn is the size of a user's D degree network, T is a maxmium number of given consecutive purchases.

#### Time complexity :


- worst run-time: O(T*N + Dn) 

#### Space complexity:

- worst space complexity: O(N^2 + T*N) 

I only changed process_log.py function, everything remains unchanged.

- Python Version: 2.7
